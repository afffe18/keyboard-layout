# keyboard-layout

This is my personal keybard layout I use daily on my pc. It includes many mathematical symboles you could need. Its based on the German QWERTZ layout with many additions. It mostly just adds new keybinds but there are a few Keys that I've put somwhere else, namely are "€","$" and brackets "{","[","]","}" curencies are now all sorted at the bottom right and brackets are mooved to ä&ö which makes it easier to reach them when coding.


lowercase  &  AltGr (blue)
<div align="center">
  <img src="./media/lowercase_layout.png"/>
</div>


uppercase  &  Shift+AltGr (blue)
<div align="center">
  <img src="./media/uppercase_layout.png"/>
</div>


I also took advantage of modifier keys like "^" or "´","`"`like you can see below. I know that some of them aren't needed but I decided to include them anyways. If you would need them, You have them




List of hopefully all currently added caracters in a kinda sorted way:

# keyboard-layout

This is my personal keybard layout I use daily on my pc. It includes many mathematical symbols you could need. Its based on the German QWERTZ layout with many additions. It mostly just adds new keybinds but there are a few Keys that I've put somewhere else, namely "€","$" and brackets "{", "}", "[", "]" currencies are now all sorted at the bottom right and brackets are moved to ä&ö which makes it easier to reach them when coding.

## installation 
1. run the .exe in the zip file. It is auto generated by [MSKLC](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134)
2. Go to Settings → Time & language → Language & region 
3. click on the 3 dots next to German (Germany) [if not shown install the German Language Pack by clicking "Add a language"] and select language options
4. click "Add a Keyboard" and select "German - Custom V10 by afffe18  [...]"

To uninstall simply run the .exe again

## content
lowercase  &  AltGr (blue)

uppercase  &  Shift+AltGr (blue)
<div align="center">

I also took advantage of modifier keys like " ´ ", " ` " and " ^ " (pictures below in that order). I know that some of them aren't needed but I decided to include them anyways.

Furthermore AltGr + Space prints an Halfspace 
and the "," on the numbpad is by default a ".". The "," can be archievd by pressing shoft simultaniously
